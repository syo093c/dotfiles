Hey, here is my shell configuration ;)


**INSTALL**

you need to install fzf at first, or some function will not work as expect.

oh my god zsh, lovely tmux, neovim, favorite XMonad !

``` bash
sudo apt install fzf # for debian
sudo emerge -av fzf # for gentoo
sudo pacman -S fzf # for archlinux
```

``` bash
bash install.sh
```
